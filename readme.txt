CONTENTS OF SWMM524_GUI.ZIP
=============================

This archive contains source code for the Windows graphical user
interface portion of Version 5.2.4 of the Storm Water Management
Model (SWMM). The interface was written using Embarcadero's Delphi
10.4 (www.embarcadero.com). The name of the Delphi project containing
the code is Epaswmm5. All of the files for the project can be found
in the Epaswmm5 folder within this archive.

Before the Epaswmm5 project can be loaded into Delphi's Integrated
Development Environment (IDE), several special components must be
installed into the IDE's component pallette. The source code for
these components is contained in the Components folder in this
archive. Consult the Installation.txt file in that folder for
instructions on how to install these components.
