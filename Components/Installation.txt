Directions for Installing the EPA Custom Components into Delphi 10
==================================================================

This file explains how to install the EPA custom components into Delphi 10
so that both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of SWMM 5.2 can be built.

If the EPA components were previously installed to Delphi's component palette
we recommend that they first be removed before executing these instructions
(from Delphi's main menu select Component | Install Packages, then select EPA
Components from the list of Design Packages and click the Remove button).

1. Unzip the Components.zip file to a new directory named Epa under the
   directory where you normally store other component packages.

2. Launch Delphi and open Epa.dproj from the newly created EPA directory.

3. From the Projects window select Windows 32-bit as the Target Platform
   (expand the Target Platforms node, right-click on Windows 32-bit and
   select Activate).

4. Select Project | Options from the main menu. In the Options dialog that
   appears select Delphi Compiler from the left panel. Then in the right panel,
   for the "Package output directory" option click the ellipsis and create a
   new directory named Win32 under the Epa directory. Do the same for the
   "Unit output directory" option.

5. Build the 32-bit component package by selecting Project | Build Epa from
   the main menu bar.

6. Select Windows 64-bit as the Target Platform from the Projects window.

7. Repeat Step 4 for the 64-bit target but name the new output directory Win64.

8. Build the 64-bit component package by selecting Project | Build Epa from
   the main menu bar.

9. Install the component package to Delphi's component palette by:
   a. selecting Component | Install Packages from the main menu.
   b. A window with a list of installed packages will appear - click the Add button.
   c. In the file selection dialog that appears navigate to the Epa\Win32 directory
      and select the "epa.bpl" file. 
   d. The EPA Components package will now appear on the list of installed packages.
   e. Click the OK button to complete the installation.

<< THE NEXT STEPS ARE VERY IMPORTANT>>

10. Select Tools | Options from the Delphi IDE main menu bar and in the left panel of
    the Options form that appears select Language | Delphi | Library.

11. In the right panel of the form set the Selected Platform to "Windows 32-bit".

12. Click the ellipsis button next to Library Path and add the EPA components folder
    to the list.

13. Then set the Selected Platform to "Windows 64-bit" and again add the EPA
    components folder to the Library Path.
